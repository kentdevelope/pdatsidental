        <h2>VISION</h2>
    <h4>
        The role of a dental receptionist in the past was simplistic. The duties
        included greeting patients, answering the telephone, scheduling appointments,
        and other basic secretarial functions. However, as the years progressed with 
        the evolution of modern technology, the receptionist's role has likewise evolved
        to a more complex one. Beyond the basic administrative function, comes the need
        for efficient chairside assisting and other circulating or roving functions 
        such as taking dental radiographs, operating specialized dental equipment, maintaning
        responsibility for sterlization and infection control procedures.
